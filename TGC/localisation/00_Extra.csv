EVTDESC187620;Legendary showman (and scam artist) P.T. Barnum opened his first three-ring circus in 1871, beginning a circus craze that would last well into the 20th century. Of course, most of the excitement and the curios he displayed were all fake, but that was all part of the show - and the money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT187630DESC;"In order to improve the efficiency of railroads in our nation, we have adopted a system of standard time to prevent any confusion between train stations on the length of our railroad networks. We will name the centre of these time-zones ""Confederate Standard Time,"" and we believe that this idea will be well-liked by similarly minded countries.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT187640DESC;Pioneered by men like Scott Joplin and Ernest Hogan, ragtime is a genre of music that began amongst African-Americans in the South. Afterwards, it became widely known and widely played on piano, and had a key role in popularizing new music recording methods and the later genre of jazz.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT187650DESC;"Blues music, like ragtime and jazz before it, was first played and composed by Afro-American musicians of the American South. While jazz enjoyed popularity amongst blacks and whites in the 1920s and 1930s, blues was mostly relegated to black listeners until after the Second World War. It was arguably formed as a musical genre in 1912 with the publishing of Hart Wand's ""Dallas Blues,"" but has its roots in traditional slave songs of the 19th century. Most famously, blues later became the bedrock for the most popular musical sensation of them all: rock n' roll.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT187660DESC;Though the North always was the industrial centre of America, in the Deep South there was the city of New Orleans, always full of sound and lights. The epitome of southern prosperity, New Orleans was a hub of trade and immigration, and at its peak was the third largest city in the entire United States.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT187670DESC;The city of New Orleans always has had an association with the festival of Mardi Gras, a Christian cultural celebration taking place prior to the season of Lent brought to the area by French Catholic colonists. Normally it is meant to be just a single day of celebrations, but in New Orleans the colourful and energetic Mardi Gras can last for several days more. Mardi Gras was recognized as an official state holiday of Louisiana in 1875.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT187680DESC;Politeness, etiquette, and the warm comforts of home: these define the ideal of Southern hospitality, and is a major characterizing point of our nation. People are expected to respect their neighbours and use polite terms even when addressing strangers. Some feel that this is an act put on to cover up Southern flaws such as slavery and widespread poverty, but its nature can be traced back to the traditional Christian moral influence on the Southern states before secession. Regardless, it's made a good mark on our country, and we're proud of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT187690DESC;Founded in 1871, the National Rifle Association was originally a set of shooting clubs organized to improve the marksmanship of American soldiers. After the Civil War, it was noted that few shots fired actually hit their targets, so improved drill was in order. These shooting clubs improved skill with firearms, and contributed to the military as a whole moving away from the classic style of rank and file warfare, which put focus on volume of fire rather than accuracy. Within a few decades, firearms and marksmanship became a proud part of the country's culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT187700DESC;One hundred years ago, the Thirteen Colonies organized and succeeded in their rebellion against their British colonial oppressors, forming the United States of America on the 4th of July, 1776. We have seen this country through fire and water, but by God, we will never let America fall. Now unto the end of time, the United States will be a shining name in the pages of history, a beacon of freedom and democracy in the world. Today of all days, we truly should be proud.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT187710DESC;Travelling along the western trails into California, a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ wagon group known as the Donner party has been discovered... or, at least, what is left of it. The people of the Donner party were stranded in the wilderness for so long that their minds were lost, and they succumbed to cannibalism and other savage acts. With the revelation of this news, the world can now see the mortifying reality of life in Western America.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT187720DESC;Due to recent heavy rainfall and the negligence of a local construction company, a dam on the Little Conemaugh River has burst, flooding and decimating Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The cleanup costs will be higher than any disaster we've seen before, and more importantly, the people will soon be looking for someone to place the blame upon. The government could step in and take care of everything in place of the local industrialists and clubs that may have caused the flood, or we can require that the groups pay from their own pockets to fix their mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT187730DESC;Though our war with the Confederate States is far from over, it isn't going either poorly or well. However, that doesn't stop the war from being a contentious issue, and in New York most notably the people have staged an uprising against the local government, demanding that the strict conscription practices in place for the war be rescinded. We're in the middle of a war, so we have to choose some way to deal with them, without sacrificing our draft. The question is, are these riots worth putting down, or are our other concerns far greater?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT187740DESC;"James Madison, fourth president of the United States of America and the man titled ""The Father of the Constitution,"" was a key figure in the founding of our nation. On June 28th, 1836, he passed away - much to the chagrin of those close to him, who wished for him to follow the ""tradition"" of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, who both died on Independence Day.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT187750DESC;The Gulf of Mexico is no stranger to extreme wind and rain, but in 1900, a certain hurricane blew away any old records. The storm decimated Galveston, Texas, and reached the Canadian Maritimes before dissipating completely. In cost of lives and money, few other disasters can compare, and this is an especially heavy blow for the coastal areas of the Gulf and Texas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT187760DESC;"A man going by the name of Doctor Howard Henry Holmes has been apprehended and executed after murdering up to two-hundred people after the last $COUNTRY_ADJ$ World's Fair. According to police reports, he built up a so-called ""Murder Castle"" in $CAPITAL$, killing primarily young women that he lured to his lair. Using legitimate medical contacts he was able to dispose of the bodies, and for a long time he remained far out of suspicion. Only after leaving the city due to economic troubles did Holmes end up being captured, as a result of alleged horse theft. Afterwards the truth of his grisly crimes came to light, and he was sentenced to death.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT188000DESC;An infestation of boll weevils has struck our cotton crops in $PROVINCENAME$! Farmers are fearing that our supply of cotton won't last with this insect terrorizing our provinces, and many are suggesting that we abandon cotton to focus on different trade goods. Should we follow their advice, or try to recover the cotton?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT188100DESC;Rising up from the south, the boll weevil is a dreadful little insect that seems to have little interest in anything but planting its eggs in cotton flowers and buds. Regardless of its origins, it poses a major threat to our cotton industry, and must be stopped at all costs. For the time being, though, we fear that there may be no direct way of containing the insect, not on a large scale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC187810;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has brought an end to slavery in their country thanks to British diplomacy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187820;With the renegade states at our capital and the White House in ruins, we have no choice but to move the center of our nation to somewhere more secure.

EVTDESC187830;The Confederate Americans have already pushed into our heartlands, and now they have laid claim to our capital in Mexico City. We have no choice now but to move our administration to Morelia, the Spanish colonial capital from before Mexico's independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC187870;With the loss of our colonies in Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, there really is no point in maintaining slavery in this modernizing world. Rather than a step forward in the name of liberty, this is more or less a formality, but certainly the people won't see the difference.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187880;Historically, Brazil and the Confederate States of America enjoyed warm relations, even during the Civil War. Shall we foster an alliance between these two nations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187890;There are a growing number of Freemasons within Brazilian churches, which is nominally prohibited in Catholicism - they exist most commonly within Lay Fraternities, which are generally charitable organizations chiefly associated with local churches, though technically independent in their operation. Historically, however, the church in Brazil has been an apparatus of the state, rather than being independent, thus making religious issues in Brazil matters of the state, not the Catholic Church. Local bishops have been calling for Freemason clergymen to resign, including a man named Dom Vital, who has issued an interdict against certain Lay Fraternities that have refused to have their Freemason brothers resign, preventing any sacraments from being celebrated within these Fraternity buildings. This goes against the state control of the Church, so the Lay brothers say, and is a direct challenge to government power considering that certain members of Parliament are noted Freemasons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187892;Dom Vidal has refused to annul his controversial interdict, and has been joined in protest by the bishop Antonio de Macedo Costa, who has recently passed a similar interdict against uncooperative Lay Fraternities. This refusal could be used as a reason to arrest and imprison the bishops, hopefully preventing them from causing more trouble in the future, and to remove them as challenges to the authority of the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187894;Vidal and Costa have been imprisoned for acting against the power of the sovereign Brazilian state, causing shock and anger amongst the Catholic populace in the country. The New Prime Minister, a Freemason and a Catholic himself, has called for his own resignation in the case that amnesty is not granted to Costa and Vidal. We have little choice at this point, considering that keeping the bishops in prison would only lead to the government crumbling. It seems we've been dragged into a situation in which we cannot end things positively.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187900;With the Civil War having swung in favour of the Confederate States, there is a growing secessionist movement in the city of New York, with locals calling for New York City to leave the Union and follow its own, independent path. With each passing day this movement gains more popularity, and this certainly will cause a problem in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187901;The inevitable has come to pass. The city of New York has ordered a referendum amongst the people, calling for secession from the United States of America. The results, legitimate or otherwise, show that the people of New York are overwhelmingly in favour of secession, and the city's officials have made it abundantly clear that, should independence be denied, there will be another Civil War at hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187902;We are at war for our freedom! This conflict will not be an easy one, but there certainly must be other countries that can aid us in achieving the independence that we need. Shall we seek them out, or face American wrath alone?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187903;Civil war rages in America, and the people of New York City have requested that we aid them in their conflict. If we choose to do so, it may anger people within our own country who seek independence, and certainly the Americans will be less than pleased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187904;Diplomats from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have declared that their nation is fully in support of New York's independence, and that we can expect to see $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ military and economic aid in the times to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC187910;Inspired by the liberal revolutions in Europe, a party of Liberals in Brazil, calling themselves the Praieiros, has begun stirring up tensions in our country. They hope to bring an end to slavery, and also expand Brazilian voting rights, in order to make a more free country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187914;The young Dom Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil, is yet too young to rule the country, due to his father abdicating in 1831 in order to restore his daughter Maria to her rightful throne of Portugal. Until the child Emperor is of age, the country will be looked over by parliamentary officials and a court of regents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187915;After much debate, it has been decided that Pedro II, though still under the age of majority, will reign without a regency. He has proven to be a very capable young man, though he is quite shy, and he is much beloved by the people. Due to the poor rulership of the regency, it will be immediately terminated, and Dom Pedro II will officially begin his reign as Emperor of Brazil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187916;Dom Pedro II, the Magnanimous, has passed away this morning. The people of Brazil loved him until the very end, and his impeccable rulership brought a true golden age to the Empire of Brazil. Working towards the cause of abolition and civil freedom, Dom Pedro made many influential friends, with his various associates, from Friedrich Nietzsche and Alexander Graham Bell to Victor Hugo and Charles Darwin. An intellectual and a devoted emperor, in his later years he found himself disappointed with the role of a ruler, so perhaps with his passing he has achieved the happiness that eluded him all his life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187917;The imperial administration of Dom Pedro II has, with the recent coup and overthrow of the government, been reduced to dust. The emperor has officially and willingly abdicated the throne, and has not tried to retake it or resist the end of the Empire. Government of the country is being transferred to a council of able governors, and the royal family of Brazil and Portugal are hereby exiled from this country for ever more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187918;In the Brazilian navy, the use of the dreaded lash to discipline soldiers has been officially banned for several years. However, many white officers still use it to keep their typically black, sometimes even ex-slave crews in line, causing accusations of institutionalized discrimination in the military. Several all-black crews have recently revolted against their officers, taken control of their ships, and are in port outside $CAPITAL$, threatening to bombard the city. They are demanding amnesty and reparations, and an end to discrimination, a promise we may not be able to completely deliver.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187919;Though the Atlantic slave trade has been dismantled by the British, many traders in Brazil have found ways to smuggle slaves into our country. Here in $PROVINCENAME$, new slaves have been sold into plantations;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187920;Near the Bagagem River, a young slave girl has found a priceless treasure: a massive diamond, certainly one of the biggest in the world. The girl, for finding this gem, has been granted her freedom, and since then the diamond, called the Star of the South, has come into our possession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187921;In order to protect the scenery and nature of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ wilderness, a service has been created to allow the flora and fauna of this country to thrive unhindered. This National Parks Service will prevent the natural environment from being unnecessarily overrun by human development, and will show to $COUNTRY$, her people, and the world, the true beauty of the wilderness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187922;Due to its fertile farmland, fair weather, close access to the Pacific and abundance of natural resources - including gold! - the state of California is rapidly booming in population, showing an unprecedented demographic increase due to natural increase and mass immigration. California will be an integral part of $COUNTRY$ in no time, and this upward trend does not look to be ending soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187923;Being a constitutional monarch, our Emperor Dom Pedro II has quite a lot of time to travel the world and meet the many personalities therein. With his daughter Isabel at home as his regent, Dom Pedro is able to visit Egypt, Britain, Austria and France, speaking with intellectuals and even ordinary people. He always demands that he is treated as just a man, and not an emperor, and he has gained considerable fame overseas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187924;California's population has drastically increased over a short period of time, and while for a time this was one of the largest migrations in our country's history, it has now begun to slow, to a trickle. California is still booming, but perhaps not as strongly as before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187925;A free man of black ancestry has given a speech at a national university. Many were impressed by his eloquence and the intelligence in his arguments against slavery, saying that 'in a land of freedom, we celebrate the sight of a man in chains.' He could become a major force in the cause of abolitionism, and already pro-slave politicians have demanded that his speeches be censored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187926;Capitalists have formed what they call a 'Progressive Society' in $PROVINCENAME$, hoping to bring an end to slavery. Their reasoning is that slavery, as a rural, plantation-based economic model, has no place in a nation attempting to industrialize and compete in the modern economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187930;In the plantation fields of $PROVINCENAME$, the sound of 'The Internationale' can be heard more loudly and frequently than old slave songs. Many working slaves, having learned to read, have also learned about the philosophies of men like Karl Marx, and his vision of a world without social classes. What they intend should be obvious, considering their situation in our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187935;Factories dot the landscape where once there used to be plantations and farms that ran on the blood and sweat of slaves. In this new $COUNTRY$, though, employers have begun hiring cheap workers, often immigrants, because the cost of keeping slaves has become unsustainable for many. Arguments could be made against them that they are sabotaging the economy, but in a free economy, they have the right to employ whomever they choose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187940;Two Confederate diplomats, hoping to establish good relations with our country, are aboard the HMS Trent. We have received urgent news lately, however, that the American USS San Jacinto has intercepted the Trent and taken the diplomats as prisoners. This can be seen as an act of war on British territory, and many are calling for an American apology and reparations for this insult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187942;We have received word that the British, after their HMS Trent was commandeered by a Union captain on the USS San Jacinto. The Trent is carrying two Confederate diplomats, en route to Britain and France, no doubt in order to coerce them into joining the war. The British are demanding an apology from our officials and the immediate release of the diplomats, and have been making isolated showings of force along the Canadian border.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187943;Delegates from the United States have apologized and released the two Confederate envoys into British care. They made several demonstrations that they would not interfere with British shipping in any way in the future, and our own officials came back quite pleased with the meeting. Of course, at this point we certainly cannot join the Confederates, or offer them any support, in light of tense Anglo-American relations as a result of the Trent affair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC187944;The United States has begun to position troops along its border with our colony in Canada, making it clear that they will not back down. Official delegates from the United States government declare that what they did was only an act of war against the Confederates, but if British diplomats press the Trent issue, then the Union will consider Britain on the side of the Confederate secessionists, and react accordingly. It seems that there is no choice now but war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

MISSFLOOD1DESC;Along the Missouri River and the Upper Mississippi, heavy rainfall and inadequate preparation have led to major floods, the worst in decades. With the increasing population of $COUNTRY$ especially in the areas around the Mississippi and its tributaries, it is becoming increasingly important to develop a set of levees and ditches to prevent high water from wiping out whole towns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MISSFLOOD2DESC;Not long after last decade's horrendous floods along the Upper Mississippi, there has been another year of rain and subsequent floods along the very same Mississippi River. We had prepared and made sure riverside towns were prepared for any threat of flooding, but this time the floods hit mostly rural and new colonial towns, which hadn't yet managed to create systems of levees to cope with rising water levels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME211490;A Historic Kris;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC211490;"In South Asian culture, a kris (an asymmetrical, usually curvy, dagger) is a spiritual and sacred object. Imbued with magical powers, they are thought to be inhabited by spirits and as such are ""almost alive"". Care of krisses is subject to great ceremony and ritual. Should the owner be negligent, the Kris might kill him in his sleep. Should the owner, however, be generous, the kris will protect him and imbue him with valour.\nRecently, the crown-prince of one of our Princely States fell ill. Neither our western physicians, nor the local Dukun proved capable of helping. In a desperate move, the prince asked the renowned 'White Dukun,' a Dutchman educated in both western and indigenous medicine, for help. Finding it as a case of guna-guna, the White Dukun worked his magic and managed to cure the crown-prince. For his efforts in securing the succession, the prince awarded the White Dukun with his the most precious pusaka: an ancient kris.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In the past few months they have made extensive maps of the coast of New Guinea: not only of the currents and water depths, but also of suitable locations for future posts. Invaluable information to us should we decide to expand to that vast land. On the naturalist side the expedition was less successful. A large number of hitherto unknown species of birds were discovered, and promptly killed for preservation. Aside from those samples large collection of stones and minerals was brought back. However, no grand new discoveries were made. Rather unexpectedly the expedition ran into an English naturalist called Wallace at an isolated German mission post. The man is doing research into the development of species, and claims to be on the verge of a major scientific breakthrough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Invaluable information to us should we decide to expand to that vast land. On the naturalist side the expedition was fairly routine. A few new bird species discovered, some interesting rocks found. Nothing to get to excited about. That is untill, rather unexpectedly, the expedition ran into an English naturalist called Wallace at an isolated German mission post. The man has been travelling the archipelago to research, what he calls, the introduction of new species. Impressed by how well our expedition was outfit, he saw an opportunity for collaboration and joined the expedition.

However, on one of the naturalist excursions into the forest, the expedition members disappeared! The soldiers sent into the forest after them, could not locate them. Later at night, bright fires could be seen deep in the forests, with loud noises emerging from it. We can only assume the worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

We have finally finished rebuilding the palace. The original palace had three floors, but, as future protection against earthquakes, the new palace only has one. Of particular importance is 's Lands Plantentuin (the botanical gardens) surrounding the palace. Originally founded as a forest for rare species of plants during the Sunda Kingdom, they currently serve a primary research institute for the development and cultivation of new species of plants. As such, it is one of the most important institutes of tropical research in the world, and of vital importance to the plantation economy on Java.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

His intriguing background and not unremarkable skill have made him a much beloved court painter. And while he may be most famous for his portait work, he has shown remarkable skill in painting landscapes as well. Often depicting exotic scenes from his homeland, offering an insight into a world unknown to most Europeans. Rasen Saleh's arrival at court can only mean he is looking for our patronage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC211509;"Raden Saleh is a Javanese painter has made quite a name for himself in the courts of Europe.  This 'Eastern Prince,' son of a noble family, has studied the modern European painting techniques under our patronage, and is possibly the first oriental to do so. He has shown particular aptitude towards painting portraits, and many a ruler has been immortalised by his work. His landscapes too are a sight to behold. Inspired by his native land, the paintings show exquisite detail in the wild animals he depicts. But perhaps his most important work is his depiction of the capture of Prince Diponegoro at the Java War, provocatively depicting a noble prince Diponegoro and slightly ""unbalanced"" colonial officers.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME211590;The Nederlansch Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC211590;One of the causes of the Belgian Revolution was our language policy. The majority of the elites, being Francophone, disdained Dutch and our efforts to make it the national language. It should thus come as no surprise that, after independence, French was swiftly elected as the official language. This has caused some resentment among the Flemish, who find it gives precious little room for their own cultural expression.\nIn an effort to strengthen the cultural base of Dutch in Belgium, Flemish language scholars have joined up with Dutch language scholars in Ghent for an international language and literature congress. The development and unification of the Dutch language is one of the main goals of the congress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME211591;The First Dictionary;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC211591;For much of history, there has not been a unified Dutch language. Numerous regional varieties exists, with Hollandic Dutch being the most prominent. A movement towards a unified language does exist, but it hampered by a lack of an unambiguous structure of the language. Official rules regarding the language do exist, but they too show regional differences. Language scholars have now recommended to create one national dictionary, and get rid of the regional differences in spelling and pronunciation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME211592;The Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC211592;After many years of work, the first true dictionary of the Dutch language has been produced: The Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal. While there may have been earlier dictionaries, perhaps most famously by 16th century scholar Kiliaan, none of these were of the calibre of this new dictionary. They were mainly translation dictionaries, or used regional spelling differences. The 'Nieuw Woordenboek der Nederandsche Taal' uses the new (official and unified) spelling rules.\n\nThe dictionary as released is only the first of a large series. The aim of the dictionary is to describe every word in use in the Dutch language since 1500. Such a massive task will take many more years to complete.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME211593;Nieuw Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC211593;The teacher and scholar Johan van Dale has published a new dictionary of the Dutch language. It is based on the recent 'Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal', but has been significantly improved upon. The definitions given in the original dictionary were found to be to vague and imprecise by van Dale. As a teacher he aimed his dictionary at students, and desired a clear cut and precise definition of words.\n\nThe dictionary is often referred to as 'De Dikke van Dale' [The Thick one by van Dale], because, at 1400 pages, it is the thickest book in the common household, after the Bible of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME211601;The Great City Fire of Enschede;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC211601;A mayor fire has turned the entire medieval city of Enschede to ashes. 650 houses were destroyed, which in a city of only 4000 people means more than half of all citizens are left homeless. A number of factors can be blamed, drought, strong winds, improper fireproofing, but our own contribution to the fire should not be overlooked: in celebration of the king's visit the city was beautifully decorated with flowers, banners and triumphal arches. All of which proved to be very conductive to the spread of the fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME211602;From The Life Of King Gorilla;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC211602;"King William has always been an odd bird. This is nothing new, but at least it had been kept out of the press. The (conservative) press has willingly swept it under the carpet all this time. The more radical press is less willing to cover it though. It would seem the madness of the king has reached socialist circles: a pamphlet called 'A Day in the Life of King Gorilla' was recently released and has become quite popular. The pamphlet describes ""the criminal life"" and the ""corrupted nature"" of the royal house, calling the king an unconsidered ""sadistic monster"" who cares not about his people.\nThis, combined with another recent pamphlet describing the king as ""a regal pig"" and ""horny mandrill"", triggered some passionate feelings. Royalists have found cause to attack socialists and their establishments because of this.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME211400;The Cultuurstelsel;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC211400;The wars with Belgium, on Java and on Sumatra have drained the treasury, and we are quickly heading toward financial ruin. To increase the revenue from our colonies in the East, a new system called the Cultuurstelsel has been proposed, which will require farmers to grow cash crops for export. Replacing the old Landrente-tax, which required farmers to pay 2/5th of their harvest as tax, the Cultuurstelsel requires farmers to use 1/5th of their land to grow cash crops, mainly coffee, tea, sugar and indigo. Farmers who cannot grow these crops on their land are required to provide the Herendienst: 60 days of free labour per year to work on government plantations. Should the value of crops exceed the previously paid Landrente, the farmer is compensated accordingly by the Plantloon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME211403;Overzealous Colonial Officer;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC211403;One of our lower colonial officers, an assistant-resident in Western Java, has taken a very zealous approach to his job. Disturbed by the abuses of the Cultuurstelsel and Herendienst he found in his regency, he accused the local Head of severe abuse of power and bondage of his subjects. While of course his position requires him to reign in local excesses and protect the populace, his primary concern should be the protection of our interests! Currently, the authority of the Head is sacred and unquestionable to the populace. Bringing him to court might cause severe social upheaval. As such, the Resident has called the Assistent-Resident to order and stopped the prosecution of the Head. This did not deter the Assistent-Resident. The case has now reached the Governor-General who has to decided to continue the prosecution, and risk rebellion, or put a stop to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME211404;Disgruntled Colonial Officer;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC211404;"A former colonial officer who left the service after an altercation with a local Regent, has now written to you complaining about the treatment he has received. A fervent liberal and proponent of inlander rights, he claims to have written a book detailing abuses committed by both the colonial government and local Heads under the Cultuurstelsel. Having been reduced to poverty by his treatment, he is threatening to publish this book unless he is fully rehabilitated, which in this case means: a position of Regent on Java, full restoration of his pension, a large advance and, most preposterously, a decoration for his ""service"".";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME211405;Multatuli;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC211405;"I am broker in coffee, and live on the Lauriersgracht No. 37.\nWith these words begins the novel Max Havelaar, which has by now ""sent a shudder through the land"". The novel describes the consequences of the colonial system in Java, in which government and local Heads cooperated to enrich themselves at the expense of the people. In the example of the body of the Javanese, murdered on the orders of the regent, floating down the river as a present from the sharks of the interior to the sharks in the sea, after that poor wretch had complained about the Regent, the ""humdrum"" story of that one buffalo of Saidjah's father, the village in Lampung set ablaze by Dutch forces. Cumulating in the majestic, almost terrifying, final chord in which Multatuli exposed Holland as a ""pirate state"" among the nations, and conjured the king not to tolerate any longer that more than 30 million Javanese are maltreated and exploited in his name in the ""glorious realm of Insulinde, that coiled round the Equator like a girdle of emerald"".";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME211409;Java, or How to Manage a Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC211409;Long has our colony on Java been the envy of the world. The vast wealth provided by the Cultuurstelsel has propelled our nation forwards, and this has not gone unnoticed abroad. In a recently published book, called 'Java, or How to Manage a Colony', the aptly named Englishman James Money described our colonial administration of Java, the Cultuurstelsel in particular, as the example of how a colony should be run. He writes that a similar system would solve many of the problems facing British India today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME211411;The Koloniale Kwestie;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC211411;A weighty responsibility lies on the people blessed with such history as ours. Contemporaries and progeny might rightfully question, what we, sons of such a dearly bought freedom, have done with this freedom? Can we, after three centuries, with a clean concious and our heads held high answer: We are worthy descendants of such heroes? Is it but lies and slander that we exploit the Javanese?\n[...]\nThe Cultuurstelsel has made our country the disgrace of the world. We have surrendered the honour of being a civilised nation: for even the Spanish did not treat our forefathers so unchristian.\nThat a moral nation pur sang like ours, which does not rely on brute force but moral superiority in international politics, should allow for her subjects to be exploited, has started to create a feeling of unease in society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME211900;Maatschappij tot Nut van den Javaan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC211900;"A new 'Society to the Benefit of the Javanese' has been founded with to combat all injustice against Javanese, no matter the source. The society considers it a great sin that, in our name, Javanese should be exploited. Being the foremost Christian nation under God, it should fall to us to uplift the inlanders! Perhaps under our guidance can the Javanese can do away with their superstitions and join the ranks of civilised peoples. The society has started to raise money to fund (Christian) schools in the East.\nThe paternalistic nature of the society, however, has not fallen well with more liberal elements of our society. Multatuli, perhaps the foremost ""friend of the Javanese"", has published a damning commentary of their work: ""He who does indeed value Civilisation does not ridicule her by spreading more or less illustrated school books, prints and atlases to those who he systematically exploits, abuses and murders"".";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME211901;Baron Van Hoevell;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC211901;"People of the Netherlands, does a bloodguilt not burn on your consciousness? For two centuries has your flag flow on Java: For two centuries you have waived the sceptre of domination: Millions upon millions have flowed to your treasure on the toiling of the inlanders: And you have returned nothing to them.\nMember of Parliament Wolter Robert baron van Hoevell has emerged as one of the strongest critics of our colonial administration of Java and the Cultuurstelsel in particular. Originally serving as a minister in Batavia, he was forced to leave the Indies due to his liberal and anti-governmental tendencies. Very popular in the Indies: it is said that when he left, he was sent of by ""half of Batavia"". As one of the few MPs who has actually visited the Indies, he can describe the situation there with great expertise and ""disturbing eloquence"".";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME211418;The Agrarische Wet;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC211418;While vital for the financial well-being of our nation, the Cultuurstelsel has its opponents. Especially in liberal circles there is a lot of criticism of the system. They view the Cultuurstelsel as an inefficient and inflexible economic system, unable to respond adequately to changing circumstance. In their view the East Indies would benefit from opening up to private capital. The treatment of the Inlanders is also a point of contention. They hold the Cultuurstelsel as deeply immoral, as it denies the local education, Christianity and the blessings of progress. The Agrarische Wet seeks to abolish the Cultuurstelsel and its governmental plantations, and open the East Indies up to private investment. Ownership of the land is returned to the Inlanders and western individuals can lease lands from them or the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME211440;The Suikerwet;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC211440;The Agrarische Wet has been the first step in abolishing the Cultuurstelsel. However due its economic importance, the sugar industry had been exempted from the Agrarische Wet. This never set well with the liberal elements of society, and they have always pushed to end the governmental monopoly on sugar. A bill has now been brought to a vote in parliament to this effect.\nUnder the Suikerwet the government relinquishes its monopoly on sugar, and opens the sugar market to private capital, provided the sugar is refined in Dutch refineries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME211441;The Koffiewet;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC211441;While in the days of the VOC spices such nutmeg and cloves might have been the economic motor of the Indies, since the late 18th century coffee has been the cork keeping our economy afloat. Therefore, when the Agrarische Wet was passed, the coffee cultures were specifically exempted. This never set right with the liberals and other proponents of a liberal economy. A bill has now been brought to a vote in parliament to finally bring an end to Cultuurstelsel, and the governmental monopoly on the coffee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME211445;The Ethische Politiek;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC211445;The Indies have always been a profit centre to our nation. While great wealth has flowed to our great nation, the poor inlanders have seen little benefit from our rule. In fact, they have suffered dearly from abuse and exploitation under our rule. Some would say we have incurred a debt of honour towards the inlanders. They are proposing we follow a more Ethical Policy towards the inlanders. We would take ethical responsibility towards our inlander populace, and extend all benefits from being part of our great nation towards them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME211800;The Pill Bandoeng;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC211800;Malaria is an ever present danger in the tropical regions of the world. There are few effective treatments for the disease, and those which do exist are expensive. Our control over the production of Quinine from the Cinchona tree has given our citizens abundant and relatively cheap access to the medicine. However, the inlander population has been unable to profit from this, and continues to be ravaged by the disease. A bill has been proposed in parliament to fund the construction of a large Quinine factory on Java. This factory will be specifically to supply the natives with this important medicine, and extend the benefits of Dutch civilisation to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME211801;The School tot Opleiding van Inlandsche Artsen;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC211801;We have always kept medical professions in the Indies a strictly western affair. There have been hospitals and doctors for inlanders, but never any inlander doctors and physicians. This has obviously had a negative effect on the access to modern medical care for inlanders. Most are now surrendered to the whims of the dukuns, and the magic and superstition they perpetrate. To combat this, and improve the plight of our colonial subjects, it has been suggested we start training inlanders in the medical profession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Speeches during the demonstration were made about joint fight against Russian Empire to free Congress Poland. Inspired by the events in Berlin, a demonstration in Poznañ was organized and the authorities agreed to creation of delegation that would bring proposals of Polish side to Berlin and to the Prussian King. A Polish National Committee, dominated by conservatives and liberals, was formed. Armed peasants and townspeople attacked Prussian administrative offices and clashed with troops. Meanwhile, the National Committee, which would have been satisfied with autonomy for the duchy, entered into negotiations with the Prussian authorities, counting on concessions from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC188130;After the Ausgleich, representatives of the Polish aristocracy and intelligentsia addressed the Emperor asking for greater autonomy for Galicia. Their demands were not accepted outright, but over the course of the next several years a number of significant concessions were made toward the establishment of Galician autonomy. From 1873, Galicia was de facto an autonomous province of Austria-Hungary with Polish and, to a much lesser degree, Ukrainian or Ruthenian, as official languages. The Germanisation had been halted and the censorship lifted as well. Galicia was subject to the Austrian part of the Dual Monarchy, but the Galicia Diet and provincial administration had extensive privileges and prerogatives, especially in education, culture, and local affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Chopin was born in what was then the Duchy of Warsaw, and grew up in Warsaw, which after 1815 became part of Congress Poland. A child prodigy, he completed his musical education and composed many of his works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising.

EVTNAME132700;Taras Shevchenko Dies;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC132000;"Taras Shevchenko, a gifted Ukranian artist, has published his first major piece, a painting entitled ""The Beggar Boy Giving Bread to a Dog"". This piece is amazing, considering that it came from a man who until recently had been a serf. This painting seems to be stirring consciousness in Ukraine, but for now let us enjoy it for its excellence.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC132100;"Taras Shevchenko has been working for the past few years, but he recently made a defining piece named ""Picturesque Ukraine"". This has created a small awakening in the Ukraine, fueled by his unique paintings and stirring literature. Historically, Taras Shevchenko is even considered the father of the modern Ukrainian language and art styles.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC132200;"Taras Shevchenko was found in the company of Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius, known dissidents against the Tsardom. During the raid of their headquarters, Shevchenko's new poem, ""The Dream"", was found. This poem personally attacked the Tsar Nicholas I and his wife. Although Tsar Nicholas personally read the poem, and was quite amused at the parts attacking him, he purportedly flew into a rage when the poem attacked his wife. Although a pardon for Shevchenko was likely, the attack against the Tsar's wife was the last straw, and Shevchenko was thrown into custody.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC132300;Although exiled from his native Ukraine and his residence in Saint Petersburg, Taras Shevchenko still had quite a bit of freedom. Even though the orders from the Tsar were to prevent him from working on painting and literature, the enforcement was very lax. The Tsar still had a soft spot for Shevchenko, and so the artist continued his work. Indeed, he was sometimes assigned to the military as a sketch painter, and his travels to Khazakstan and the Urals continued to shape his world-view.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC132400;After ten years of imprisonment, the Tsar has felt pity for Taras Shevchenko and has pardoned him for his crimes. Although Shevchenko was ordered to the Nizhniy Novgorod area, his works are increasing in number and he has expressed a desire to go back to his native Ukraine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC132500;Taras Shevchenko has finally returned to his native land after many years of toil in Russia. However, he was soon after charged with blasphemy and ordered to return to Saint Petersburg. His quick visit to the Ukraine raised consciousness about the Ukrainian people, and influenced his works in the days to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC132600;Taras Shevchenko has died due to his ill health. Although he barely spent any time in his native Ukraine, he will always be remembered as the father of the modern Ukrainian nation, language, and culture. His will requested that he be buried in his native Ukraine, and efforts are underway to give him a proper burial and wake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC99400;Now that the southern aristocracy has been forced to free their slaves, free blacks, along with the American Colonization Society have begun on a program for willing colonists to settle Liberia. Supporting this program would anger most of the Afro Americans in our nation, however this could be the solution for the ethnic issues between whites and black - even if it means we have to force them to go to Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME236900;The Entente Cordiale;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC236900;The Entente Cordiale was a series of agreements signed between the United Kingdom and France. The beginning of the 20th century saw both nations diplomatically isolated from other European powers, France by the skillful German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, and the United Kingdom by their own choice of "Splendid Isolationism". With the balance of power shifting it would be wise to reconcile the rift that has existed between the British and French peoples for generations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT180000DESC;Now that the war is over, the question arises whether or not we should allow the slaves we enlisted during the war to remain free, or send them back to work on the plantations. We made a promise to secure their freedom, but wars are a fickle thing, and some sacrifices have to be made for the betterment of the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT181000DESC;With the dawn of the twentieth century, slavery in modern countries is fading away due to the prevalance of industry. A mere fifty years ago $COUNTRY_ADJ$ strength may have been founded on the backs of our slaves, but as tractors, automobiles, trains and other machines are making industry replace old mass labour, we have to make a distinct choice. Do we organize our slave economy, favouring it over industrial strength, or do we join the onward march of progress and free ourselves from the shackles that a slave society has forced us into? Just as fifty years ago a great house was divided, so now our $COUNTRY$ must become all one thing, or all the other: strong in the grip of slavery, or strong in the freedom of progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME133000;Solano's Ambition;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC133000;The dictator of Paraguay, Solano Lopez, has turned his eye towards Brazilian lands to the southeast. Direct access to the Atlantic Ocean would be of great benefit to the country, rather than relying on Uruguayan permission to use the river-- permission which might not always be forthcoming, thanks to Brazilian interference. Perhaps it is time to flex Paraguay's muscle and establish an empire of our own?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME133200;The shift to liberalism!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC133200;García Moreno's death in 1875, as he himself might have forecast, brought a period of near anarchy. Conservatives and liberals struggled for power. But Ecuador had become part of the world market: the importance of the coast slowly increased, and the liberals of that area increasingly dominated the economy. A new liberal hero emerged from the lower classes as the leader of the coastal reaction to Sierra conservatism and clericalism. A man of great personal magnetism, Gen. Eloy Alfaro led a march against the Sierra in 1895 and after a year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME133300;The Aristocratic Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC133300;In 1894, Nicolás de Piérola, after allying his party with the Civil Party of Peru to organize guerrillas with fighters to occupy Lima, ousted Andr?s Avelino C?ceres and once again became president of Peru in 1895. After a brief period in which the military once again controlled the country, civilian rule was permanently established with Pierola's election in 1895. His second term was successfully completed in 1899 and was marked by his reconstruction of a devastated Peru by initiating fiscal, military, religious, and civil reforms. Until the 1920s, this period was called the "Aristocratic Republic", since most of the presidents that ruled the country were from the social elite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME133400;The Democratic Stability;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC133400;After the War of the Pacific, a vigorous debate among civilian elites spawned the development of new political parties. Mining entrepreneurs, who had become the most important economic group in the country, created the Conservative Party. Conservatives favored reaching a quick peace settlement with Chile that would include indemnification for lost territories and enable Bolivia to construct a railroad for mining exports. The Liberal Party denounced the pacifism of the Conservatives. Despite these differences, both parties were primarily interested in political and economic modernization, and their ideological outlooks were similar. The governments in power from 1880 to 1920?elected by a small, literate electorate brought Bolivia its first relative political stability and prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC133500;After the liberal José Manuel Balmaceda was elected president of Chile in 1886, he fostered public works, improved health care and public education. In 1890, his programs met opposition in the Chilean congress, which rejected his budget. Balmaceda announced in early 1891 that he would proceed without the congress, which soon deposed him and appointed naval officer Jorge Montt as provisional president. The navy supported the congress, while Balmaceda retained control of the army and exercised dictatorial powers in the capital of Santiago. The civil war ended with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME133600;The Uruguayan Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC133600;On July 18, 1830, Uruguay enacted its first constitution. Uruguay's leaders fiercely protected free speech within the nation's parliament - even when legislators voiced views that directly opposed those of the president. These measures did not mean that Uruguay's early decades were easy or calm, however: in addition to threats from its much larger neighbors, the young nation suffered from internal strife. The new constitution had made José Fructuoso Rivera the country's first president. When his political rival, Manuel Oribe became president in 1834, Fructuoso revolted against him. By the mid-1830s, two fiercely opposed political parties had emerged from these internal struggles. Oribe headed a group called the Blancos, who mainly represented gauchos, shepherds, and other rural citizens. Fructuoso led their opponents, the Colorados, who were more supportive of the residents of Montevideo and their business interests. As battles between the groups increased, the rivalry grew into a civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

As tension ran high in the island, and several petitions to the Sultan went unanswered, armed bands were formed, an the uprising was officially proclaimed in $YEAR$.
